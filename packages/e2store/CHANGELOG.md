## 10.0.0 - 2025-04-29

### Overview

This release is part of the `v10` breaking release round making the `SilaJS` libraries compatible with the [Pectra](https://sips.sila.org/SIPS/sip-7600) hardfork going live on Sila `sila-mainnet` on May 7 2025. Beside the hardfork update these releases mark a milestone in our release history since they - for the first time ever - bring the full `Sila` protocol stack - including the `SAVM` - to the browser without any restrictions anymore, coming along with other substantial updates regarding library security and functionality.

Some highlights:

- 🌴 Introduction of a tree-shakeable API
- 👷🏼 Substantial dependency reduction to a "controlled dependency set" (no more than 10 + `@Noble` crypto)
- 📲 **SIP-7702** readiness
- 🛵 Substantial bundle size reductions for all libraries
- 🏄🏾‍♂️ All libraries now pure JS being WASM-free by default
- 🦋 No more propriatary `Node.js` primitives

So: **All libraries now work in the browser "out of the box"**.
